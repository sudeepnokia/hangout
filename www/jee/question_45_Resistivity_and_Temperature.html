    <h1>Learning Guide: How Temperature Affects Resistance</h1>
    <p>This guide explains how the electrical resistance of different types of materials changes as they get hotter or colder.</p>

    <!-- Phase 1: The Foundation -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 1: What is Resistivity?</h2>
        <div class="concept">
            <p><strong>Resistance (R)</strong> is a measure of how much a specific object (like a piece of wire) opposes the flow of electric current. It's measured in Ohms (&Omega;).</p>
            <p><strong>Resistivity (&rho;)</strong> is a more fundamental property of a <span class="highlight">material</span> itself. It tells you how resistive that substance is, regardless of its shape or size. A material with low resistivity is a good conductor (like copper), and a material with high resistivity is a poor conductor (like rubber).</p>
            <p>The question asks about resistivity (&rho;) versus temperature (T), which is a fundamental material property.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 2: Conductors (Metals) -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 2: Conductors - The Traffic Jam Analogy</h2>
        <div class="concept">
            <p>In a metal conductor, electrons flow freely. Think of them as cars on a highway.</p>
            <p>When you <span class="highlight">increase the temperature</span>, the metal atoms themselves start vibrating more and more violently. These vibrating atoms get in the way of the flowing electrons, causing more "collisions".</p>
            <p>It's like adding random, shaking obstacles to the highway. The flow of traffic (current) is obstructed more. Therefore, for conductors:</p>
            <p><strong>As Temperature (&uarr;), Resistivity (&uarr;).</strong></p>
            <p>The relationship is nearly linear for a wide range of temperatures. The graph of &rho; vs. T is a line that slopes upwards.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 3: Semiconductors -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 3: Semiconductors - The Reluctant Employee Analogy</h2>
        <div class="concept">
            <p>In a semiconductor (like silicon), electrons are not as free as in a metal. They need an energy boost to break free and conduct electricity.</p>
            <p>When you <span class="highlight">increase the temperature</span>, you are giving these electrons the energy they need to break free and become charge carriers. More heat means more free electrons available to carry current.</p>
            <p>It's like an office where employees need a lot of coffee (energy) to start working. More coffee (heat) means more employees get up and start moving (conducting).</p>
            <p>Even though the collisions from Phase 2 also increase, the effect of creating more charge carriers is much more dominant. Therefore, for semiconductors:</p>
            <p><strong>As Temperature (&uarr;), Resistivity (&darr;).</strong></p>
            <p>The relationship is not linear; it's an exponential decay. The graph of &rho; vs. T is a curve that slopes downwards.</p>

    <!-- Phase 4: The Final Phase -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 4: The Summit - The JEE Main Question</h2>
        <div class="problem">
            <p><strong>Original Question:</strong> Which of the following resistivity (&rho;) v/s temperature (T) curves is most suitable to be used in wire bound standard resistors?</p>
        </div>
        <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleSolution(this)">Show/Hide Solution</button>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Let's think about what makes a good "standard resistor". A standard resistor is used as a reference in circuits. You want its resistance to be reliable and predictable. If you build a circuit with a 100 &Omega; standard resistor, you want it to be 100 &Omega; whether your room is cold or hot.</p>
            <p>This means the ideal material for a standard resistor is one whose <span class="highlight">resistivity changes very little with temperature</span>.</p>
            <p>Let's analyze the graphs provided in the question:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Graph (1):</strong> Shows resistivity decreasing sharply as temperature increases. This is the behavior of a <span class="highlight">semiconductor</span>. Not good for a standard resistor.</li>
                <li><strong>Graph (2):</strong> Shows resistivity increasing sharply and linearly as temperature increases. This is the behavior of a typical <span class="highlight">metal conductor</span>. Also not ideal, as its resistance would change a lot with temperature.</li>
                <li><strong>Graph (3):</strong> Shows resistivity decreasing, similar to a semiconductor. Not suitable.</li>
                <li><strong>Graph (4):</strong> Shows a material that has a certain resistivity, and as the temperature increases, that resistivity <span class="highlight">barely changes at all</span>. The line is almost flat.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This fourth graph represents the ideal behavior for a standard resistor. We want a material that is insensitive to temperature changes.</p>
            <p>Materials like this exist! They are special alloys, such as Manganin or Constantan, which are specifically engineered to have a very low temperature coefficient of resistivity. They are used to make high-precision, wire-wound standard resistors.</p>
