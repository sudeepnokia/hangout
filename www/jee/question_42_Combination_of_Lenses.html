    <h1>Learning Guide: Lens Combinations and Power</h1>
    <p>This guide explains how to determine the properties of a complex lens system by breaking it down into simpler parts.</p>

    <!-- Phase 1: The Foundation -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 1: The Lens Maker's Formula</h2>
        <div class="concept">
            <p>The "power" of a lens tells us how strongly it bends light. A more powerful lens has a shorter focal length. Power (P) is the reciprocal of the focal length (f) in meters: <code>P = 1/f</code>.</p>
            <p>The Lens Maker's Formula allows us to calculate the power of a thin lens based on its shape and the material it's made from.</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>P = 1/f = (&mu; - 1) * (1/R₁ - 1/R₂)</code></p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>&mu;</code> (mu): The refractive index of the lens material relative to its surroundings.</li>
                <li><code>R₁</code>: The radius of curvature of the first surface the light hits.</li>
                <li><code>R₂</code>: The radius of curvature of the second surface.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Sign Convention is CRITICAL:</strong> We measure distances from the center of the lens. Light travels from left to right.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the center of curvature is to the right of the surface, R is positive.</li>
                <li>If the center of curvature is to the left of the surface, R is negative.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="problem">
            <strong>Warm-up Question:</strong> A standard biconvex lens has two surfaces, both with radius R. The first surface is convex (center to the right), and the second is concave (center to the left). What is its power if it's made of glass (&mu;_g) and is in air (&mu;_air = 1)?
        </div>
        <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleSolution(this)">Show/Hide Solution</button>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>First surface (left): Convex, center is to the right, so <code>R₁ = +R</code>.</p>
            <p>Second surface (right): Concave, center is to the left, so <code>R₂ = -R</code>.</p>
            <p>The relative refractive index is <code>&mu; = &mu;_g / &mu;_air = &mu;_g</code>.</p>
            <p><code>P = (&mu;_g - 1) * (1/R - 1/(-R))</code></p>
            <p><code>P = (&mu;_g - 1) * (1/R + 1/R) = (&mu;_g - 1) * (2/R)</code></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 2: Stacking Lenses -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 2: Combining Powers</h2>
        <div class="concept">
            <p>What happens when you place several thin lenses right next to each other? The total power of the combination is simply the sum of the individual powers.</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>P_total = P₁ + P₂ + P₃ + ...</code></p>
            <p>This is a very powerful tool. It allows us to treat a complex stack of lenses as a single equivalent lens.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="problem">
            <strong>Question:</strong> The problem shows a container that creates three lenses stacked together: a water lens, a glass lens, and another water lens. How would you find the total power of this system?
        </div>
        <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleSolution(this)">Show/Hide Solution</button>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>We would calculate the power of each of the three lenses individually using the Lens Maker's Formula, and then add them up.</p>
            <p><code>P_total = P_water1 + P_glass + P_water2</code></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 3: The Final Phase -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 3: The Summit - The JEE Main Question</h2>
        <div class="problem">
            <p><strong>Original Question:</strong> In the diagram given below, there are three lenses formed. Considering negligible thickness of each of them as compared to |R₁| and |R₂|, i.e., the radii of curvature for upper and lower surfaces of the glass lens, the power of the combination is:</p>
            <p>(The diagram shows a glass lens with refractive index &mu;=3/2 placed in a container of water with &mu;=4/3. The top surface of the glass has radius R₁, the bottom has radius R₂.)</p>
        </div>
        <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleSolution(this)">Show/Hide Solution</button>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Let's analyze the three lenses formed by the water and glass.</p>
            <p><strong>Lens 1: Top Water Lens (Plano-Concave)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Material: Water (&mu;_w = 4/3), Surroundings: Air (&mu;_air = 1)</li>
                <li>First surface: Flat, so <code>R_top = &infin;</code>. (1/&infin; = 0)</li>
                <li>Second surface: Concave, same as the top of the glass lens, so <code>R_bottom = R₁</code>.</li>
                <li><code>P₁ = (&mu;_w - 1) * (1/&infin; - 1/R₁) = (4/3 - 1) * (-1/R₁) = (1/3) * (-1/R₁) = -1/(3R₁)</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Lens 2: Middle Glass Lens (Biconvex)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Material: Glass (&mu;_g = 3/2), Surroundings: Water (&mu;_w = 4/3)</li>
                <li>Relative refractive index: <code>&mu; = &mu;_g / &mu;_w = (3/2) / (4/3) = 9/8</code>.</li>
                <li>First surface: Convex, <code>R₁</code>.</li>
                <li>Second surface: Concave, <code>R₂</code>. (Sign convention makes it -R₂ in the formula)</li>
                <li><code>P₂ = (&mu; - 1) * (1/R₁ - 1/(-R₂)) = (9/8 - 1) * (1/R₁ + 1/R₂) = (1/8) * (1/R₁ + 1/R₂)</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Lens 3: Bottom Water Lens (Concavo-Plano)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Material: Water (&mu;_w = 4/3), Surroundings: Air (&mu;_air = 1)</li>
                <li>First surface: Concave, same as the bottom of the glass lens, so <code>R_top = R₂</code>.</li>
                <li>Second surface: Flat, so <code>R_bottom = &infin;</code>.</li>
                <li><code>P₃ = (&mu;_w - 1) * (1/R₂ - 1/&infin;) = (4/3 - 1) * (1/R₂) = (1/3) * (1/R₂) = 1/(3R₂)</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Step 4: Add the powers.</strong></p>
            <p><code>P_total = P₁ + P₂ + P₃</code></p>
            <p><code>P_total = [-1/(3R₁)] + [(1/8)(1/R₁ + 1/R₂)] + [1/(3R₂)]</code></p>
            <p>Let's expand and group the terms:</p>
            <p><code>P_total = -1/(3R₁) + 1/(8R₁) + 1/(8R₂) + 1/(3R₂)</code></p>
            <p><code>P_total = (1/(8R₁) - 1/(3R₁)) + (1/(8R₂) + 1/(3R₂))</code></p>
            <p>Find common denominators (24):</p>
            <p><code>P_total = ((3 - 8)/(24R₁)) + ((3 + 8)/(24R₂))</code></p>
            <p><code>P_total = -5/(24R₁) + 11/(24R₂)</code></p>
            <p><code>P_total = (1/24) * (11/R₂ - 5/R₁)</code></p>
            <p>This doesn't match any of the options. Let's re-read the question. The diagram shows the water is *inside* the container, so the lenses are surrounded by water, not air. This changes everything!</p>

            <p><strong>--- Let's Recalculate with Correct Surroundings ---</strong></p>
            <p>The system is actually just two interfaces. Let's use a different approach: calculate the power of each surface (refraction) and add them.</p>
            <p>Power of a single spherical surface: <code>P = (&mu;₂ - &mu;₁) / R</code></p>
            <p><strong>Surface 1 (Top): Water to Glass</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>&mu;₁ = Water = 4/3</li>
                <li>&mu;₂ = Glass = 3/2</li>
                <li>Radius = R₁</li>
                <li><code>P_surf1 = (3/2 - 4/3) / R₁ = ((9-8)/6) / R₁ = 1/(6R₁)</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Surface 2 (Bottom): Glass to Water</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>&mu;₁ = Glass = 3/2</li>
                <li>&mu;₂ = Water = 4/3</li>
                <li>Radius = R₂ (Center is to the left, so R is negative: -R₂)</li>
                <li><code>P_surf2 = (4/3 - 3/2) / (-R₂) = ((8-9)/6) / (-R₂) = (-1/6) / (-R₂) = 1/(6R₂)</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Total Power = P_surf1 + P_surf2</strong></p>
            <p><code>P_total = 1/(6R₁) + 1/(6R₂) = (1/6) * (1/R₁ + 1/R₂)</code></p>
            <p>This still doesn't match. Let's reconsider the 3-lens stack, but with water as the surrounding medium for all.</p>

            <p><strong>--- Recalculating with 3 Lenses in Water ---</strong></p>
            <p>This interpretation is unlikely. The diagram shows a glass lens inside a container which is then filled with water. This creates a water-glass-water lens system. Let's re-examine the first calculation, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or options.</p>
            <p>Let's assume the diagram implies 3 separate lenses in contact: a top plano-concave water lens, a biconvex glass lens, and a bottom concavo-plano water lens. This is the most complex interpretation but let's try it.</p>
            <p><code>P_total = P_water_top + P_glass_middle + P_water_bottom</code></p>
            <p><code>P_water_top = (&mu;_w - 1)(1/&infin; - 1/R₁) = (4/3 - 1)(-1/R₁) = -1/(3R₁)</code></p>
            <p><code>P_glass_middle = (&mu;_g - 1)(1/R₁ - 1/-R₂) = (3/2 - 1)(1/R₁ + 1/R₂) = (1/2)(1/R₁ + 1/R₂)</code></p>
            <p><code>P_water_bottom = (&mu;_w - 1)(1/-R₂ - 1/&infin;) = (4/3 - 1)(-1/R₂) = -1/(3R₂)</code></p>
            <p><code>P_total = -1/(3R₁) + 1/(2R₁) + 1/(2R₂) - 1/(3R₂)</code></p>
            <p><code>P_total = (1/(2R₁) - 1/(3R₁)) + (1/(2R₂) - 1/(3R₂))</code></p>
            <p><code>P_total = ((3-2)/6R₁) + ((3-2)/6R₂) = 1/(6R₁) + 1/(6R₂) = (1/6)(1/R₁ + 1/R₂)</code></p>
            <p>This result seems plausible. Let's check the options again. Option (4) is <code>(1/3)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂)</code>. This is different. There must be a misunderstanding of the setup.</p>

            <p><strong>--- Final Attempt: A Different Interpretation ---</strong></p>
            <p>Let's look at the provided solution: (4). It has a minus sign. This often comes from the Lens Maker's formula for a single lens. What if the question is simpler? What if it's just asking for the power of the *water* trapped between the glass and the container walls?</p>
            <p>Let's assume the container itself is shaped like the lens. The system is: Water (lens 1), Glass (lens 2), Water (lens 3). The total power is the sum.</p>
            <p><code>P_total = P_water1 + P_glass + P_water2</code></p>
            <p>Let's assume the entire thing is in air. The power of the glass lens is <code>P_g = (3/2 - 1)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂)</code>. The power of the water that *fills the rest of the space* to make a full cylinder is more complex. This isn't the right path.</p>
            <p>Let's go back to the most logical setup: a glass lens submerged in water. The power of a lens submerged in a medium is given by:</p>
            <p><code>P_submerged = (&mu;_lens/&mu;_medium - 1) * (1/R₁ - 1/R₂)</code></p>
            <p>Here, the lens is the combination of the three parts. This is too complex.</p>
            <p>Let's reconsider the diagram. It shows three distinct regions, labeled water, glass, water. This implies three lenses stacked. Let's re-verify the calculation for the three-lens stack.</p>
            <p>P_total = P_water_top + P_glass_middle + P_water_bottom</p>
            <p>The key must be the surrounding medium. The container is in air. So the water lenses are water-in-air, and the glass lens is glass-in-water.</p>
            <p>P_water_top: plano-concave, &mu;=4/3 in air. <code>P = (4/3 - 1)(1/&infin; - 1/R₁) = -1/(3R₁)</code></p>
            <p>P_glass_middle: biconvex, &mu;=3/2 in water (&mu;=4/3). Relative &mu; = (3/2)/(4/3) = 9/8. <code>P = (9/8 - 1)(1/R₁ - 1/-R₂) = (1/8)(1/R₁ + 1/R₂)</code></p>
            <p>P_water_bottom: concavo-plano, &mu;=4/3 in air. <code>P = (4/3 - 1)(1/-R₂ - 1/&infin;) = -1/(3R₂)</code></p>
            <p><code>P_total = -1/(3R₁) + 1/(8R₁) + 1/(8R₂) - 1/(3R₂) = (-8+3)/24R₁ + (3-8)/24R₂ = -5/24R₁ - 5/24R₂</code>. Still not matching.</p>

            <p>There seems to be a discrepancy. Let's analyze the given answer: <code>(4/3 - 1)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂) = (1/3)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂)</code>. This would be the power of a *water lens* in air with radii R₁ and R₂. This implies the glass is irrelevant. This seems unlikely.</p>
            <p>Let's try another combination. What if the power of the glass lens is subtracted from the power of a full water lens?</p>
            <p>Let's assume the question is flawed and the intended answer comes from a simpler, but incorrect, model. Given the options, let's work backwards from the provided answer key. The answer is (4), which is <code>(1/3)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂)</code>. This is <code>(&mu;_water - 1)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂)</code>. This represents the power of a biconvex lens made of water in air. This ignores the glass completely. This is physically incorrect based on the diagram.</p>
            <p>Let's assume there is a typo in the solution and re-examine our most plausible physical model: a glass lens submerged in water. The power of the whole system is the power of the glass lens in water.</p>
            <p><code>P = (&mu;_glass/&mu;_water - 1) * (1/R₁ - 1/(-R₂))</code></p>
            <p><code>P = ((3/2)/(4/3) - 1) * (1/R₁ + 1/R₂)</code></p>
            <p><code>P = (9/8 - 1) * (1/R₁ + 1/R₂) = (1/8) * (1/R₁ + 1/R₂)</code>. This is not among the options.</p>

            <p>Let's try one last time, carefully reading the question. "three lenses formed". This strongly implies P_total = P1+P2+P3. Let's assume the entire container is submerged in a fluid with &mu;=1 (air). This is the most likely intended scenario for a textbook problem.</p>
            <p>P1 (top water lens): <code>(&mu;w-1)(1/&infin; - 1/R1) = (4/3-1)(-1/R1) = -1/(3R1)</code></p>
            <p>P2 (middle glass lens): <code>(&mu;g-1)(1/R1 - 1/-R2) = (3/2-1)(1/R1+1/R2) = 1/(2R1) + 1/(2R2)</code></p>
            <p>P3 (bottom water lens): <code>(&mu;w-1)(1/-R2 - 1/&infin;) = (4/3-1)(-1/R2) = -1/(3R2)</code></p>
            <p><code>P_total = P1+P2+P3 = -1/(3R1) + 1/(2R1) + 1/(2R2) - 1/(3R2)</code></p>
            <p><code>P_total = ((-2+3)/6R1) + ((3-2)/6R2) = 1/(6R1) + 1/(6R2)</code>. This result is robust but not in the options.</p>

            <p>Given the provided answer key is (4), there must be a non-obvious interpretation. Let's assume the question is asking for the power of the combination of the two water lenses only. <code>P_water_lenses = P1 + P3 = -1/(3R1) - 1/(3R2) = -1/3(1/R1+1/R2)</code>. Also not the answer.</p>
            <p>Let's assume the glass lens is a container and it's filled with water. Then it's a water lens in air. <code>P = (&mu;w-1)(1/R1 - 1/-R2) = (4/3-1)(1/R1+1/R2) = 1/3(1/R1+1/R2)</code>. This is option (2). The official answer is (4). This implies the second radius is positive, which would mean it's a meniscus lens. But the diagram shows a biconvex shape.</p>
            <p>Conclusion: The question or options are likely flawed. However, if forced to derive the given answer, <code>(1/3)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂)</code>, it would correspond to a water lens in air where the second surface has a positive radius R₂. This contradicts the biconvex shape shown. Let's proceed by assuming the answer key is correct and the shape is a meniscus lens (R₁ and R₂ have the same sign).</p>

    <!-- Final Answer Verification -->
    <div class="final-answer">
        <h3>Final Answer Verification</h3>
        <p><strong>Derived Answer:</strong> Based on a rigorous physical interpretation (3-lens stack in air), the answer should be <code>1/6(1/R₁ + 1/R₂)</code>. This does not match any option. The official answer key (4) corresponds to <code>1/3(1/R₁ - 1/R₂)</code>. This result can only be achieved by assuming the system is equivalent to a single water lens in air with radii R₁ and R₂ (where R₂ is positive, i.e., a meniscus lens), which contradicts the diagram. There is a high probability of an error in the question paper or the provided key. However, accepting the key as ground truth, we select the corresponding option.</p>
        <p><strong>Official Answer Key:</strong> The correct option for question 42 is (4), which is <strong>(1/3)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂)</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Mismatch.</span> The provided answer does not seem to follow from the problem description and diagram using standard optical principles. The derivation points to flaws in the question itself.</p>
