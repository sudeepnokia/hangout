    <h1 class="main-title">Build Your Skills: Conditional Probability</h1>
    <p>This guide will build your understanding from basic probability to solving a tricky JEE-level problem about dependent events.</p>

    <div class="problem-box">
        <strong>The Scenario:</strong> A bag contains <strong>4 White</strong> and <strong>6 Black</strong> balls. Total balls = 10.
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 1: The Foundation -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 1: Basic Probability</h2>
        <p>Probability is the chance of something happening. The formula is: <code>P(Event) = (Number of ways the event can happen) / (Total number of possible outcomes)</code>.</p>
        <div class="question">
            <strong>Question 1.1:</strong> If you pick one ball from the bag, what is the probability it is black?
        </div>
        <span class="toggle-solution" onclick="toggleSolution('sol1_1')">Show Solution</span>
        <div class="solution" id="sol1_1">
            <p>Number of black balls = 6.</p>
            <p>Total number of balls = 10.</p>
            <p>P(Black) = 6 / 10 = 3/5.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 2: Dependent Events -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 2: When One Event Affects Another</h2>
        <p>Things get interesting when we don't put the first ball back. This is called "without replacement". The first draw changes the probabilities for the second draw.</p>
        <div class="question">
            <strong>Question 2.1:</strong> What is the probability of drawing a black ball, and then (without replacing it) drawing another black ball?
        </div>
        <span class="toggle-solution" onclick="toggleSolution('sol2_1')">Show Solution</span>
        <div class="solution" id="sol2_1">
            <p>Probability of the first ball being black is <code>P(1st is B) = 6/10</code>.</p>
            <p>After taking one black ball, the bag now has 5 black balls and 4 white balls (9 total).</p>
            <p>So, the probability of the second ball being black is now <code>P(2nd is B) = 5/9</code>.</p>
            <p>The combined probability is the product of the two steps: <code>P(B and then B) = (6/10) * (5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3</code>.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 3: The "Given That" Clue -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 3: Thinking Backwards - Conditional Probability</h2>
        <p>This is the core idea. What if we know the outcome of the second event, and want to find the probability of the first? This is called <strong>Conditional Probability</strong>.</p>
        <p>The formula is <code>P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)</code>. It reads "The probability of A happening, given that B happened, is the probability of both happening divided by the total probability of B happening."</p>
        <div class="question">
            <strong>Question 3.1:</strong> We need <code>P(B)</code>, the total probability of the second ball being black. A black ball can be picked second in two ways: (Black, Black) or (White, Black). Calculate the total probability.
        </div>
        <span class="toggle-solution" onclick="toggleSolution('sol3_1')">Show Solution</span>
        <div class="solution" id="sol3_1">
            <p>Path 1: P(Black and Black) = 1/3 (from Phase 2).</p>
            <p>Path 2: P(White and Black) = P(1st is W) * P(2nd is B after W) = (4/10) * (6/9) = 24/90 = 4/15.</p>
            <p>Total P(2nd is Black) = P(Path 1) + P(Path 2) = 1/3 + 4/15 = 5/15 + 4/15 = 9/15 = 3/5.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 4: The Summit -->
    <div class="phase" style="background-color: #e9f7ef; border-color: #a7d7c5;">
        <h2>Phase 4: The JEE Main Question</h2>
        <p>You now have all the concepts and values needed to solve the final problem.</p>
        <div class="question">
            <strong>Question 3:</strong> Two balls are selected at random one by one without replacement from a bag containing 4 white and 6 black balls. If the probability that the first selected ball is black, given that the second selected ball is also black, is m/n, where gcd(m, n) = 1, then m + n is equal to:
        </div>
        <span class="toggle-solution" onclick="toggleSolution('sol4_1')">Show Solution</span>
        <div class="solution" id="sol4_1">
            <p><strong>Step 1: Identify the events.</strong></p>
            <p>A = The first ball is black.</p>
            <p>B = The second ball is black.</p>
            <p>We want to find <code>P(A | B)</code>.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2: Use the conditional probability formula.</strong></p>
            <p><code>P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)</code></p>
            <p><strong>Step 3: Plug in the values from our previous phases.</strong></p>
            <p><code>P(A and B)</code> is the probability of (Black, Black), which we found in Phase 2 is <strong>1/3</strong>.</p>
            <p><code>P(B)</code> is the total probability of the second ball being black, which we found in Phase 3 is <strong>3/5</strong>.</p>
            <p><code>P(A | B) = (1/3) / (3/5) = (1/3) * (5/3) = 5/9</code>.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4: Solve the final part of the question.</strong></p>
            <p>The probability is <code>m/n = 5/9</code>. So, m=5 and n=9. gcd(5,9)=1.</p>
            <p><code>m + n = 5 + 9 = 14</code>.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
