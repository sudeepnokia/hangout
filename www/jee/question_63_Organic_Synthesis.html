    <h1>Learning Guide: A Multi-Step Aromatic Synthesis</h1>
    <p>This guide breaks down a four-step organic synthesis, explaining the purpose and outcome of each reaction.</p>

    <!-- Phase 1: The Reactions -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 1: The Reagent Toolkit</h2>
        <div class="concept">
            <p>Let's understand what each set of reagents does. The starting material is nitrobenzene.</p>
            <p><strong>(i) Br₂, AcOH (Acetic Acid):</strong> This is an <span class="highlight">electrophilic aromatic substitution</span>, specifically bromination. The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strong <span class="highlight">deactivator</span> and a <span class="highlight">meta-director</span>. This means it makes the benzene ring less reactive and directs any new substituent to the meta position (carbon 3 or 5).</p>
            <p><strong>(ii) Sn, HCl:</strong> This is a standard reagent for the <span class="highlight">reduction of a nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂)</span>. The tin metal in acidic solution is a powerful reducing agent for this specific transformation.</p>
            <p><strong>(iii) NaNO₂, HCl, 273 K (0&deg;C):</strong> This is the <span class="highlight">diazotization</span> reaction. It converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). This reaction must be kept cold because diazonium salts are unstable at higher temperatures.</p>
            <p><strong>(iv) C₂H₅OH (Ethanol):</strong> Ethanol can act as a <span class="highlight">reducing agent</span> for diazonium salts, replacing the entire -N₂⁺ group with a hydrogen atom (-H). This is a common deamination reaction.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 2: Step-by-Step Synthesis -->
    <div class="phase">
        <h2>Phase 2: Following the Trail</h2>
        <div class="problem">
            <p><strong>Original Question:</strong> The products formed in the following reaction sequence are:</p>
            <p>Nitrobenzene &rarr; (i) Br₂, AcOH &rarr; (ii) Sn, HCl &rarr; A + B &rarr; (iii) NaNO₂, HCl, 273K &rarr; (iv) C₂H₅OH</p>
            <p><em>(Note: The question is slightly ambiguous with "A+B". In this context, it usually means the major product from step (ii) is carried forward, and we need to identify the final products.)</em></p>
        </div>
        <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleSolution(this)">Show/Hide Solution</button>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Let's trace the starting material through each step.</p>
            <p><strong>Starting Material:</strong> Nitrobenzene</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9O8F1yF.png" alt="Nitrobenzene" style="width:150px;"/>

            <p><strong>Step (i): Bromination (Br₂, AcOH)</strong></p>
            <p>The -NO₂ group directs the incoming Br to the meta position.</p>
            <p><strong>Product of Step (i):</strong> m-Bromonitrobenzene</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YJ4a4xW.png" alt="m-Bromonitrobenzene" style="width:150px;"/>

            <p><strong>Step (ii): Reduction (Sn, HCl)</strong></p>
            <p>The nitro group (-NO₂) is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂). The bromine is unaffected.</p>
            <p><strong>Product of Step (ii):</strong> m-Bromoaniline. Let's call this compound A.</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rA2wJ2g.png" alt="m-Bromoaniline" style="width:150px;"/>

            <p><strong>Step (iii): Diazotization (NaNO₂, HCl, 0&deg;C)</strong></p>
            <p>The amino group (-NH₂) is converted to a diazonium salt group (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).</p>
            <p><strong>Product of Step (iii):</strong> m-Bromobenzenediazonium chloride.</p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sJ3g9fB.png" alt="m-Bromobenzenediazonium chloride" style="width:180px;"/>

            <p><strong>Step (iv): Reaction with Ethanol (C₂H₅OH)</strong></p>
            <p>This step involves two simultaneous reactions. The diazonium salt is the main reactant.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Deamination:</strong> The primary reaction is the reduction of the diazonium salt. The entire -N₂⁺ group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. This converts our molecule back to bromobenzene.</li>
                <li><strong>Ether Formation:</strong> Ethanol (C₂H₅OH) can also act as a nucleophile and attack the diazonium salt, but more importantly, it can react with the diazonium salt in a substitution reaction to form an ether. The ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) replaces the diazonium group. This gives m-Bromoethoxybenzene.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxidation of Ethanol:</strong> In the process of reducing the diazonium salt, the ethanol itself gets oxidized. Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) is oxidized to ethanal (acetaldehyde, CH₃CHO).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The question asks for the products A and B. Based on the options, it seems A is the main organic product from the main sequence, and B is the side-product from the final step.</p>
            <p>Let's re-examine the options. The options show pairs of products. This suggests the reaction sequence might produce two major organic products in the final step.</p>
            <p>Let's reconsider step (iv). When a diazonium salt is warmed with ethanol, it can undergo two major pathways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Substitution:</strong> The -N₂⁺ group is replaced by the -OC₂H₅ group from ethanol. Product: m-bromoethoxybenzene.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduction:</strong> The -N₂⁺ group is replaced by -H. Product: Bromobenzene.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The options provided in the JEE paper suggest a specific set of products. Let's look at option (3): m-bromoethoxybenzene and m-bromoaniline. This doesn't make sense. Let's look at option (4): m-bromoethoxybenzene and acetaldehyde. This represents the ether formation and the oxidation of ethanol. This is a plausible set of products.</p>
            <p>Let's look at the provided answer key: (3). This suggests the products are m-bromoethoxybenzene and m-bromoaniline. This is chemically unlikely. m-bromoaniline is the reactant for step (iii), not a product of step (iv).</p>
            <p>There is a high probability of an error in the question or the answer key. Let's analyze the most likely intended transformation based on standard textbook reactions.</p>
            <p>The reaction of a diazonium salt with ethanol is complex. However, a common outcome taught is the formation of an ether (substitution) and the corresponding reduction product. The options provided are confusing. Let's assume the question is asking for the major organic product of the main sequence and the major organic byproduct.</p>
            <p>Major product from sequence: m-bromoethoxybenzene (from substitution).</p>
            <p>Major byproduct: Acetaldehyde (from oxidation of ethanol).</p>
            <p>This corresponds to option (4). The provided answer key (3) is likely incorrect.</p>

            <p>Let's try another interpretation. What if A and B are the two major organic products from step (iv)? These would be the substitution product (m-bromoethoxybenzene) and the reduction product (bromobenzene). This pair is not in the options.</p>

            <p>Given the inconsistencies, let's stick with the most textbook-perfect reaction: Diazonium salt + Ethanol -> Ether + Acetaldehyde. This is option (4). Since the provided answer is (3), let's try to understand how that could be possible. It can't. m-bromoaniline is a reactant for the diazonium step, not a product from the ethanol step. The question or key is flawed.</p>

    <!-- Final Answer Verification -->
    <div class="final-answer">
        <h3>Final Answer Verification</h3>
        <p><strong>Derived Answer:</strong> Based on standard reaction mechanisms, the most plausible products from step (iv) are the ether (m-bromoethoxybenzene) and the reduced product (bromobenzene), along with the oxidized ethanol (acetaldehyde). The options are poorly constructed. Option (4) [m-bromoethoxybenzene and acetaldehyde] represents a plausible outcome. Option (3) [m-bromoethoxybenzene and m-bromoaniline] is chemically incorrect as m-bromoaniline is a reactant, not a product of the final step.</p>
        <p><strong>Official Answer Key:</strong> The provided answer key for question 63 is (3).</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Mismatch.</span> The provided answer key contradicts fundamental principles of organic synthesis. The question is likely flawed.</p>
