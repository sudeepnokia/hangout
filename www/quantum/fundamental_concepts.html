            <h2 class="section-title">1. Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                The bedrock of quantum computing. It describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels.

            <h3 class="concept-title">Qubits, Superposition, and Entanglement</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                A <strong>qubit</strong> is the basic unit of quantum information. Unlike a classical bit, which can be a 0 or a 1, a qubit can exist in a <strong>superposition</strong> of both states simultaneously. Furthermore, multiple qubits can be <strong>entangled</strong>, meaning their fates are linked, regardless of the distance separating them. These properties are what give quantum computers their immense potential power.

            <h2 class="section-title">2. Semiconductor & VLSI</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) is the process of creating integrated circuits by combining millions or billions of transistors on a single chip. This is the technology that powers all modern electronics.

            <h3 class="concept-title">CMOS and Fabrication</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                <strong>CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)</strong> is the dominant technology for constructing integrated circuits. The documents in this section explore how to adapt CMOS technology to operate at <strong>cryogenic temperatures</strong> to control and read out qubits. <strong>Fabrication</strong> refers to the industrial processes (like lithography and etching) used to build these chips. The goal is to leverage these mature and precise techniques to build high-quality, scalable qubit arrays.

            <h2 class="section-title">3. Electromagnetism & Optics</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                This area of physics is crucial for controlling qubits and for enabling communication between them.
            </p>
            <h3 class="concept-title">Microwaves and Photonics</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Qubits are often controlled by carefully tuned <strong>microwave</strong> pulses. <strong>Photonics</strong> involves the use of light (photons) to transmit information. The idea of "photonic interconnects" is to use optical fibers to link different quantum modules, which could be a key to building large, scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge here is <strong>transduction</strong>—the efficient conversion of quantum information from microwave signals to optical signals and back again.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                The science of producing and studying very low temperatures.

            <h3 class="concept-title">Operating Near Absolute Zero</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Quantum effects are extremely fragile and can be easily destroyed by thermal noise. To protect the delicate quantum states of the qubits, quantum computers must be operated in highly controlled environments at temperatures close to absolute zero (-273.15°C or 0 Kelvin). A major engineering challenge is <strong>heat dissipation</strong>, as even the tiny amount of heat generated by control electronics can be enough to disrupt the qubits.
