            <h2 class="section-title">Step 1: The Qubit - More Than a Bit</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Everything in classical computing starts with the <strong>bit</strong>, which can be either a 0 or a 1. It's like a light switch: either on or off.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                The fundamental building block of quantum computing is the <strong>qubit</strong>. A qubit can also be a 0 or a 1, just like a classical bit. However, it can also be in a state of <strong>superposition</strong>, which means it can be a combination of both 0 and 1 at the same time.
            </p>
            <div class="analogy-box">
                <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of a classical bit as a coin lying flat on a table, either heads (0) or tails (1). A qubit is like that same coin while it's spinning. It's neither heads nor tails, but a blend of both possibilities. Only when you stop it (measure it) does it land on one specific state.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2 class="section-title">Step 2: Superposition - The Power of "And"</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Superposition is the qubit's ability to be in multiple states at once. It's not just 0 or 1, but a probability wave of possibilities. This allows quantum computers to process a vast number of calculations simultaneously. If you have two qubits, you can represent four states (00, 01, 10, 11) at the same time. With 300 qubits, you can represent more states than there are atoms in the known universe.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                This is the source of a quantum computer's potential power. It explores many paths at once, rather than one at a time like a classical computer.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2 class="section-title">Step 3: Measurement - The Collapse of Possibility</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                This is a crucial and often strange concept. A qubit remains in superposition only when it's not being observed. The moment you try to measure a qubit's value, the superposition "collapses" and it randomly picks one of the classical states, 0 or 1.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                This means you can't directly "see" the superposition. Instead, quantum algorithms are cleverly designed to manipulate these probability waves so that when you finally measure the qubits, the answer you're looking for is the one that appears with the highest probability.
            </p>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2 class="section-title">Step 4: Entanglement - The "Spooky" Connection</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                You can "entangle" two or more qubits, linking them in a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter how far apart they are. If you have two entangled qubits, measuring one instantly influences the state of the other.
            </p>
            <div class="analogy-box">
                <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine you have a pair of "magic" coins. You give one to a friend and take the other to the opposite side of the world. The instant you look at your coin and see it's heads, you know with 100% certainty that your friend's coin is tails. Entanglement is this perfect correlation.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                Entanglement is essential for complex quantum algorithms and is the basis for technologies like quantum teleportation and networking. <strong>This is the core concept behind Photonic Interconnects:</strong> the goal is to create and maintain entanglement between qubits in different physical modules.
            </p>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2 class="section-title">Step 5: Decoherence - The Enemy of Quantum</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Quantum states like superposition and entanglement are incredibly fragile. Any interaction with the outside world—a stray bit of heat, a vibration, an electromagnetic field—can disturb the qubit and destroy its quantum information. This process is called <strong>decoherence</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                Decoherence causes the qubit to collapse out of its superposition into a simple classical state (0 or 1), erasing the quantum computation. This is the single biggest challenge in building a quantum computer.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                <strong>This is why the VLSI documents are so important:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Qubit Fabrication:</strong> We need to build qubits from materials that are extremely well-isolated and have long "coherence times."</li>
                    <li><strong>Cryogenic CMOS:</strong> We need to put the control electronics right next to the qubits, but this creates heat. Cryo-CMOS is an attempt to create ultra-low-power electronics that can operate at near-absolute-zero temperatures without generating enough heat to cause decoherence.</li>
                </ul>
