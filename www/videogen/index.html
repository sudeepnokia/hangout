                <div class="text-sm">
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The three people are standing still, posing for the photo. They look a little stiff.</p>
                    <p><strong>PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S., muffled):</strong> Okay, everyone, get ready! On the count of three... one... two...</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> Old-timey camera shutter sound.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man on the left subtly tries to puff out his chest and look more imposing. The woman in the middle subtly tries to smooth down her sari. The woman on the right subtly tries to adjust her smile to look more natural.</p>
                    <p><strong>MAN (V.O., thinking):</strong> I am the man of the house. I must look strong and dependable.</p>
                    <p><strong>MIDDLE WOMAN (V.O., thinking):</strong> I hope this photo turns out well. I want to send it to my sister.</p>
                    <p><strong>RIGHT WOMAN (V.O., thinking):</strong> Is this smile okay? Do I look friendly? I feel like I'm grimacing.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> Three different "thinking" sound effects, like a "boing," a "ding," and a "poof."</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> A stray dog suddenly runs into the frame, barks once, and then runs off.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A loud, unexpected "WOOF!"</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The three people are startled. Their stiff poses are broken, and they are all looking in the direction the dog went, with surprised expressions.</p>
                    <p><strong>PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.):</strong> ...three! Perfect!</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> Another old-timey camera shutter sound, capturing the chaotic moment.</p>

                <div class="text-sm">
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man is climbing the "horizontal" stairs with exaggerated difficulty, panting and groaning as if scaling a treacherous mountain.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> Dramatic, intense climbing music. Grunting sounds.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> He finally reaches the top (the side) and triumphantly steps inside the white frame. He strikes a heroic pose, looking out at the "sideways" ocean.</p>
                    <p><strong>MAN (V.O., deep and resonant):</strong> I have conquered the horizontal mountain! I am one with the frame! I am... ART!</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> Music swells to a glorious crescendo.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> A seagull flies past (off-screen). A white "splat" of bird poop lands squarely on the top of the frame he's holding.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A loud seagull cry, immediately followed by a wet, comical "SPLAT!" sound. The triumphant music cuts off abruptly.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man's triumphant expression instantly sours. He looks up in disgust at the bird poop.</p>
                    <p><strong>MAN (V.O., annoyed):</strong> Oh, come on! Is nothing sacred?</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> Sad trombone sound ("wah-wah-wah").</p>

                <div class="text-sm">
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The camera is focused on the back of the sofa. Everything is quiet.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> Suspenseful, submarine-like "pinging" sound.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man's head slowly rises from behind the sofa, his eyes wide and scanning the room like a periscope.</p>
                    <p><strong>MAN (V.O., whispering dramatically):</strong> Periscope depth. No hostiles detected. The package is secure.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The "pinging" continues, with the added sound of a whirring motor.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> A woman's hand suddenly enters the frame and places a cup of tea on the back of the sofa, right in front of the man's face.</p>
                    <p><strong>WOMAN (O.S., cheerfully):</strong> Here's your tea, dear!</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A loud, cheerful "ding-dong!" sound, cutting off the suspenseful music.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man's "secret agent" demeanor is instantly broken. He blinks, looking startled, then smiles sheepishly at the camera.</p>
                    <p><strong>MAN (V.O., sighing):</strong> Mission... compromised.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A sad trombone sound ("wah-wah-wah").</p>

                <div class="text-sm">
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man is staring intently at the camera, as if deep in thought.</p>
                    <p><strong>MAN (V.O., thinking):</strong> Hmm... what should I have for dinner tonight? Pizza? Tacos? Or maybe...</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A low, thoughtful humming sound.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> Suddenly, a lightbulb above his head (one of the light fixtures in the background) flickers on and off.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A classic "idea" sound effect, like a "ding!" or a "chime."</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man's eyes widen in mock realization. He has a "eureka!" moment.</p>
                    <p><strong>MAN (V.O., triumphantly):</strong> Leftover spaghetti! It's been in the fridge for a week, but I'm sure it's still good. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A triumphant fanfare.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man smiles confidently at the camera, as if he's just solved a major world problem.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The fanfare continues, then ends with a comical "thud" sound.</p>

                <div class="text-sm">
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> A close-up on the photo of Joseph E. Julian. The camera slowly zooms in on his face.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> Gentle, reflective music.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The camera pans over to the text on the memorial card, showing his name and the dates of his life.</p>
                    <p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O., warm and respectful):</strong> A life is not measured in years, but in the love and memories we leave behind.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The music continues, with a soft, gentle swell.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The camera pans back to the photo of Mr. Julian, and a soft light seems to glow from within the image.</p>
                    <p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> In our hearts, you are with us always.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The music fades out peacefully.</p>

                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A faint, expectant drumroll.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man starts to laugh, a big, genuine belly laugh. The woman is also laughing, but she's trying to stifle it with her hand.</p>
                    <p><strong>STEVE (O.S.):</strong> ...and then the penguin says, "No, I'm just here for the ice cream!"</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A loud, boisterous laugh track, mixed with the man's real laughter.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man continues to laugh, while the woman starts to lose her composure, her shoulders shaking with laughter.</p>
                    <p><strong>WOMAN (V.O., thinking):</strong> It's not even that funny, but his laugh is so contagious! I'm going to snort. I can feel it.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The laugh track gets louder and more chaotic.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man is now wiping tears from his eyes, still laughing. The woman has completely given up trying to hide her laughter and is now laughing uncontrollably.</p>
                    <p><strong>MAN (V.O., still laughing):</strong> Classic Steve! He gets me every time.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The laugh track reaches a crescendo, then fades out with a final, satisfying "guffaw."</p>

                    <p><strong>FRIEND 2 (O.S. text message tone):</strong> Send a pic!</p>
                    <p><strong>PERSON:</strong> (Voiceover, as they take the photo) I have no idea what I'm doing. But if I send a weird enough photo, maybe they'll stop asking.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The classic WhatsApp "swoosh" sending sound.</p>

                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A slightly out-of-tune, but enthusiastic, rendition of "Happy Birthday."</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man's smile becomes a little more strained as the singing continues. He gives a slight, almost imperceptible eye-roll.</p>
                    <p><strong>MAN (V.O., thinking):</strong> Okay, we're on verse three now. Are they going to do the "and many more" part? I hope not. My cake is melting.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The "Happy Birthday" song continues, with a few more voices joining in, making it even more chaotic.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> A small child runs into the frame and hugs the man's leg.</p>

                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man looks down at the child, his strained smile replaced by a genuine, warm laugh. He pats the child's head.</p>

                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A cheerful, upbeat party song begins to play.</p>

                    <p><strong>YOUNGER MAN (V.O., thinking):</strong> Is he serious? Did he really just say that? I thought we were talking about fertilizer.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The instructional music falters for a moment, then resumes.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The younger man leans in closer to the rose bush and whispers to it.</p>
                    <p><strong>YOUNGER MAN (whispering to the rose bush):</strong> You are a very beautiful rose. You have lovely petals and a delightful fragrance. You are the best rose in the whole world.</p>

                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> A slow, romantic, old-fashioned melody.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man and woman exchange a quick, nervous glance, then immediately look back at the camera.</p>
                    <p><strong>MAN (V.O., thinking):</strong> I feel so... stiff. Is my tie straight? I hope I don't sneeze.</p>
                    <p><strong>WOMAN (V.O., thinking):</strong> I hope this doesn't take too long. I'm starting to get hungry. I wonder what's for dinner.</p>
                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The romantic music continues, with the added sound of a faint stomach rumble.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The man, trying to look more relaxed, attempts to put his arm around the woman's shoulder, but he is so stiff that it looks more like he's trying to put her in a headlock.</p>

                    <p><strong>SCENE:</strong> The woman gives him a sharp, sideways glance, and he quickly retracts his arm, returning to his original, stiff pose. They both look at the camera with wide, innocent eyes.</p>

                    <p><strong>AUDIO:</strong> The romantic music swells, then ends with a final, dramatic flourish.</p>
